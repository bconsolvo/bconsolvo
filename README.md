| [How to Set Up Cloud-Based Distributed Training to Fine-Tune an LLM](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/videos/cloud-based-distributed-training-fine-tune-an-llm.html#gs.9sldf8) [![How to Set Up Cloud-Based Distributed Training to Fine-Tune an LLM](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/2df2c978-17a6-4727-8e31-d1d65cb5db54)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/videos/cloud-based-distributed-training-fine-tune-an-llm.html#gs.9sldf8) | Learn how to fine-tune [nanoGPT](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) (124M parameter) model on a cluster of CPUs on Google Cloud Platform. The model is trained on the [OpenWebText](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skylion007/openwebtext) dataset in a distributed setting, using 4th Gen. Intel® Xeon® Scalable CPUs. The project builds upon the initial codebase of [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), by Andrej Karpathy. The objective is to understand how to set up distributed training so that you can fine-tune to your specific objective. The end result of training here will result in a base LLM that can generate words, or tokens, but it will only be suitable for your use-case when you fine-tune it on your specific task and dataset. |
| [Seismic Data to Subsurface Models with OpenFWI: Training an AI Model with PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvk3Rr-OjU0&t=757s) [![Seismic Data to Subsurface Models with OpenFWI: Training an AI Model with PyTorch](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/4a67d2be-0470-4324-ac8c-b89e3217088a)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvk3Rr-OjU0&t=757s) | Obtaining an accurate “picture” of the subsurface is not as simple as snapping a picture on a smartphone. Seismic exploration is a key component in creating images of the subsurface and finding essential minerals in the subsurface. Building images of the subsurface is akin to ultrasound technology used to image the human body. Learn how to train a neural network with PyTorch on a CPU, going directly from seismic data to a subsurface model. |
| [Find the Humor in Text Data: NLP with Intel & Habana*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/videos/finding-the-humor-in-text-data-nlp-intel-habana.html?) [![Find the Humor in Text Data: NLP with Intel & Habana*](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/e9661f04-f5f0-4884-976b-6c3d40167e7a)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/videos/finding-the-humor-in-text-data-nlp-intel-habana.html?) | Learn how to train a binary classification natural language processing (NLP) model on a humor dataset, where each statement is labeled as humorous or not humorous. The training is performed on a powerful Intel Gaudi GPU. Also learn how to quantize a model to speed up inference by 1.8x, taking it from FP32 format to INT8 format without significant accuracy loss. |
| [CPU accelerated fine-tuning for image segmentation using PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVZWm5GFvAw) [![CPU accelerated fine-tuning for image segmentation using PyTorch](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/0b64b923-bff0-4442-b0b7-88497863394d)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVZWm5GFvAw) | Fine-tuning neural networks has historically been quite slow and cumbersome on CPUs. However, with mixed precision BF16 training, the Intel Extension for PyTorch has made fine-tuning training feasible on a CPU and perhaps even preferred where cost and availability are key factors. In this tutorial, I will walk you through a real-world example of training an AI image segmentation model using PyTorch 1.13.1 (with ResNet34 architecture); the model will learn to identify roads and speed limits only from satellite images. | 
| [Underground Salt Domes! Fun With Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj4LVjSZYmc) [![EAGE2020 Salt Body Detection](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/079ec0e1-ebed-40a5-8997-f46b55b9f988)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj4LVjSZYmc) | Interpreting salt bodies in the subsurface is a challenging manual task that can take weeks to complete. Obtaining accurate picks of salt is very important, because errors in the placement of salt can result in severe degradation of the seismic image. The U-Net architecture proved robust with the placement of salt at 98% accuracy. Beyond accuracy, U-Net also proved to be the fastest, requiring only 3.5 hours to predict salt on the 3D seismic volume. The results presented here along with other recent studies of deep learning for salt interpretation represent a clear shift in the seismic interpretation workflow. |
| [Physics and Deep Learning for First Breaks](https://youtu.be/g8GkR6NLeqU) [![Physics Deep Learning First Breaks](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/b0eda12b-0980-4821-b1d1-30048f7bebd2)](https://youtu.be/g8GkR6NLeqU) | 	Microseismic monitoring is a crucial element to understanding hydraulic fracturing operations prior to oil and gas production. One of the more tedious quality control (QC) measures that must often be performed following a microseismic processing workflow is a visual inspection of seismic data to determine whether the data contain microseismic events or only noise. We propose using a supervised deep learning algorithm, a convolutional neural network (CNN), to automatically classify microseismic events from noise. Using our deep learning approach, we show that the time for QC can be reduced from weeks to hours with high accuracy. |
| [XGBoost* Kubeflow* Pipeline Intel® Cloud Optimization Modules for Microsoft Intel Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB3noZr8lZM&t=898s) [![XGBoost* Kubeflow* Pipeline Intel® Cloud Optimization Modules for Microsoft Intel Software](https://github.com/bconsolvo/bconsolvo/assets/15691316/5029988e-62d8-445d-8317-e299b1a9fc96)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB3noZr8lZM&t=898s) | Learn how to build secure, scalable, and accelerated XGBoost pipelines on an Azure Kubernetes service cluster, leveraging Intel SGX. This tutorial walks you through the process from setting up the container to building the full Kubeflow Pipeline using an example application.
