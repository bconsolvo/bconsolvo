### About Me

Welcome! I am happy you've arrived here to learn a bit more about me and my coding journey. I am an advocate to developers for all things data science and machine learning. I began my career in teaching, followed by geophysics, and finally ended up in data science/AI engineering. I make it my aim to be a lifelong learner and a servant leader. I originally grew up in the Great White North (Canada), but have made Texas my new home. I speak English and French and I am a proud dual citizen of Canada and the USA.


I have spent a significant amount of my career focused on the applications of deep learning and computer vision to business tasks. I have included some of these below:

| Task      | CV Methods | DL Frameworks | Architectures
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| üêü Phishing Website Detection      | Image Classification, Object Detection | [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) | Faster R-CNN, ResNet50, ResNet101 |
| üßÇ Subsurface Salt Detection   | Pixel Segmentation | [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) | U-Net |
| „Ä∞Ô∏è Microseismic Event Detection   | Binary Image Classification | [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) | CNNs |
| üåÑ First Break Picking   | Image Semantic Segmentation, Image Reconstruction | [DeepLabv3](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) | ResNet, DeepLabv3 |

### Sample Research

The research samples here are primarily examples of my work in deep learning, and my work in an advanced subsurface imaging technique called "full-waveform inversion" (FWI). Much of my work in deep learning can be summarized under two objectives:
1. Greatly reduce the time required for a particular task (eg., weeks/months to minutes) and
2. Compete or improve upon human-level accuracy
